## mythicalLibrarian
As myth2kodi is a derivative of [mythicalLibrarian](https://github.com/adamoutler/mythicallibrarian)
a lot of the documentation and forum discussions associate with that project
are still relevant:
  + [http://kodi.wiki/view/MythicalLibrarian](http://kodi.wiki/view/MythicalLibrarian)
  + [http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=65644](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=65644)

Though there are some key difference, so if you already know mythicalLibrarian
or you intend to use forums or documentation for it as a guide to myth2kodi,
make sure you take a look at:
