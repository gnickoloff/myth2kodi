Starting from the version of mythicalLibrarian that was roughly version 950, 
I began cleaning it up a little, standardising indentation, wrapping comment
lines to roughly 80, etc. Mostly for my own benefit while I figured out how it 
worked.

Subsequently decided to make significant changes, working around SchedulesDirect 
specific processing, making it work with the existing cached data when internet 
connection not available, adding some specific processing for the particular 
idiosyncrasies of FTA guide data broadcast with the digital television stations
in Sydney, Australia, and renaming mythicalLibrarian to myth2kodi to avoid 
confusion -- although, the original name was nicer...
