#
# This is the user configuration file for myth2kodi. It should be placed in
# the myth2kodi working directory (typically: /home/<username>/.myth2kodi).
# See the 'm2kdir' user setting found in the myth2kodi script, NB 'm2kdir'
# cannot be set in this configuration file but must be set correctly in the
# myth2kodi script -- as it is used to find the myth2kodi.conf file.
#
# This file is 'source'd after default values are set in the script and so can
# be used to override those defaults. For any default values you wish to
# override, simply uncomment the variable below and modify its value to suit
# your needs.
#
# It is important to check that the values of paramaters flagged with:
#   '#<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------'
# are set properly for your system.

#Specify the name of the user running mythbackend, myth2kodi should always be

#Librarian='mythtv'                           #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------


############################ Processing settings #############################

# PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE has 2 modes. 'MOVE'(DEFAULT)|'LINK':
# 'MOVE' -- Move the recording. And, by default: create a symlink at InputPath;
# 'LINK' -- Do not move, just create a sym'LINK';
#PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='MOVE'

#A modifier switch, relevant for PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='MOVE'. With this
#setting 'Enabled' a link is created from the original MythTV recording file
#location to the file just moved into your Kodi library. This enables MythTV
#to continue tracking and maintain control of the recording.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#WARNING: 'Disabled' Mode removes MythTV-DB entry, SO CANNOT BE UNDONE.
#SYMLINK='Enabled'

#If TargetPathIsInputPath is Enabled, original dir will override MoveDir. This
#is useful for multiple recording dirs. TargetPathIsInputPath will separate
#generic shows from episodes and movies. Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
#TargetPathIsInputPath='Disabled'

#ShowStopper prevents generic shows and unrecognised episodes from being
#processed. Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#ShowStopper='Enabled'

#DirTracking will check for and remove the folders created by myth2kodi
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#DirTracking='Enabled'

#FailSafe mode will enable symlinks to be formed in FailSafeDir if the move or
#symlink operation fails. Options: Enabled|Disabled
#FailSafeMode='Disabled'

#StorageGroupFallback can enable/disable a bit of code that, if Guide Data
#identified the input file as a show or episode, but no episode or series
#information was found, then it checks if the MythTV DB's storagegroup is
#movie[s] or film[s] and uses this to reset the recording type as Movie.
#To function it requires that you have created a MythTV storagegroup called
#something like 'Movies' and selected that storagegroup when making the rule
#for the recording. This works for my setup -- SAK.
#Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
#StorageGroupFallback='Disabled'

#PlotMatchFallback can be used to enable/disable a bit of code that, if a
#SeriesID has been determined but no subtitle nor Season & Episode numbers
#have been identified, falls back to fuzzy matching the Plot field from the
#Guide data in MythTV DB against the Plot data for the series, which we
#retrieved from TheTVDB and tvmaze.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#PlotMatchFallback='Enabled'

#CommercialMarkup will generate comskip files for recordings when they are moved.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#CommercialMarkup='Enabled'

#CommercialMarkupCleanup if "Enabled", when m2k_maintenance() is run, removes
#comskip & NFO files if the associated .mpg file cannot be found.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#CommercialMarkupCleanup='Enabled'


############################# Directory Settings #############################

#The path which contains myth2kodi and associated scripts default=/usr/local/bin
#binpath='/usr/local/bin'

#The directory where myth2kodi writes its temporary files, Default='/tmp'
#Typically, /tmp is tmpfs and so avoids unnecessary writes to disk. If you're
#on Linux and /tmp isn't tmpfs but you would rather avoid writing to disk then
#/dev/shm is guaranteed to be tmpfs. Alternatively, if you're short on RAM but
#don't mind some extra disk writes then use "$m2kdir". NOTE: When running with
#LOGLEVEL>=3, there are a number of temporary files that aren't automatically
#deleted, they will, however, be cleared as part of: myth2kodi --maintenance
#M2K_TMPDIR='/tmp'

#MoveDir is the folder which myth2kodi will move the file. No trailing / is
#accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#MoveDir='/media/video/tv'                    #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------

#AlternateMoveDir will act as a secondary MoveDir if the primary MoveDir fails.
#No trailing / is accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#AlternateMoveDir="$HOME/recordedTV"

#Primary Movie Dir. myth2kodi will attempt to move to this dir first. No
#trailing / is accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#PrimaryMovieDir='/media/video/movies'        #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------

#AlternateMovieDir is a fallback move dir if the primary movie dir fails.
#AlternateMovieDir="$HOME/recordedMovies"

#Primary Show Dir. myth2kodi will attempt to move to this dir first. No
#trailing / is accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#PrimaryShowDir='/media/video/recordedShows'  #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------

#AlternateMoveDir is a fallback move dir if the primary move dir fails
#AlternateShowDir="$HOME/recordedShows"

#FailSafeDir is used when the file cannot be moved to the MoveDir. FailSafe
#will not create folders. eg. /home/username
#FailSafeDir="$HOME/FailSafe"                 #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------
